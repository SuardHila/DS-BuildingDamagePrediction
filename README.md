Building Damage Prediction - Nepal Earthquake
This project focuses on predicting severe structural damage to buildings in district 3 (Kavrepalanchok), Nepal, based on structural features. Using real earthquake data stored in an SQLite database, we explore, model, and evaluate structural risk using machine learning â€” specifically decision trees and logistic regression.
